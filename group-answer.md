## Answers to Questions

1. How do we declare an if/else statement?
    Step 1: Set condition (if something happens, then something will happen)
    Step 2: Order / Command 
2. How do we make an if statement that checks two conditions? 

One statement, one result. 

For example: check if a number less than 100 and even.

```
    if ( num =< 100 && num%2 ) {    //the condition
        return true                 //command 
    }
```
   
   
Spoiler alert: in the previous question we used &&. What are the other “logical” operators? 
    && and 
        
   || or 
   
3. If we have many if statements, we can use something called a switch statement. Give an example of a switch statement.
    
    One function, but many possible cases 
```
switch(expression) {  
    case n:
        code block
        break;
    case n:
        code block
        break;
    default:
        code block
}

```
